Applications based on TRIQS
===========================

The TRIQS collaboration not only works at the elaboration of libraries to
construct new tools for the study of quantum systems. Some full-fledged
applications have readily been developed and are maintained by the TRIQS
collaboration.

DFT tools
---------

DFT tools provides an interface to DFT packages such as Wien2k for LDA+DMFT
calculation. It allows you to turn band-structure calculations obtained from
the Wien2k package to inputs to full-fledged LDA+DMFT calculations in a few
lines!

Hybridization-expansion solver
------------------------------

The hybridization-expansion solver allows to solve the generic problem
of a quantum impurity embedded in a conduction bath. It is based on a quantum
Monte Carlo algorithm that stochastically samples the diagrams of a
hybridization expansion of the partition function.

Hubbard I solver
----------------
.. warning::

   DOC IS BEING WRITTEN!


This solver gives the Hubbard I solution of a quantum impurity problem,
i.e. it solves the atomic limit. This simple approximation allows for 
very quick answers even for large multiband systems.
