 // routine for fitting the tail (singularity) of a Matsubara Green's function
 // this is a *linear* least squares problem (with non-linear basis functions)
 // which is solved by singular value decomposition of the design matrix
 // the routine fits the real part (even moments) and the imaginary part
 //(odd moments) separately, since this is more stable

 // input:
 // the input gf<imfreq> Green's function: gf
 // the known moments in the form of a tail(_view): known_moments
 // the highest fitted moment and the highest moment in the tail after the fit: max_moment
 // the index of the first and last frequency to fit (the last one is included): n_min, n_max

 // output: returns the tail obtained by fitting
